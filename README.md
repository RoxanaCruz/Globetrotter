### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the labs and group breakout rooms were helpful The instructers were helpful and i had a good time learning 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have made my website more interactive and user eye friendly by adding round corners etc.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I had a great time presenting to my group, I loved hearing everyone and saw some interactive feature for example a map and newspage.
